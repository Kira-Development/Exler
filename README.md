# Exler plugin loader
A simple Java plugin loader (i dont recommend using this, code your own)

# how it works in a nutshell
It creates a temporary file and uses fikles.copy to copy the contents of the stream from the url to the temporary file. the file acts as a plugin jar

# why i open sourced this
idk i just wanted to open source it on skibidi
